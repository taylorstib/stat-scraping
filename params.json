Next phase of this project is updating the **pull_data*.rb* files so one class can be built, and the options passed into it, instead of a separate file for each position. \r\n\r\nThe spec/ directory contains passing Rspec tests for the Scraper class, which uses Nokogiri to grab the HTML pages for the designated URLs. \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
