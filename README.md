# ESPN stat scraping for nfl

### This branch attempts to make all the code DRY
First iterations of the program were meant to be quick and dirty for pre-season analysis. I am currently building a command line application that will use NFL stats and need to make this program much more user friendly, and flexible in the syntax that it accepts. Lots of things were hardcoded previously and much of that will be corrected.
